    "One of the most impressive aspects of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability to understand the relationship between handedness and BCI (Brian Computer Interface). Upon learning about the powerful machine learning models and tools in this course, we are curious to see how our brains determine left or right hand dominance and further study the complexity of our minds. The opportunity to collect and analyze data related to brainwaves is a unique experience of our undergraduate program, and our goal of this project is to understand how brainwave data within humans influences our decision to establish hand dominance using Machine Learning and AI."

    "The hand dominance effect is one essential characteristic of hemispheric specialization in the human motor system. Independent of cultural and historical backgrounds, around 90% of humans prefer to use their right hand for skilled manipulation [1]. Understanding the brainwave of hand dominance is important for building a Brain-computer interface (BCI) as studies have suggested that handedness could contribute to the performance variations of BCI, especially when implementing motor imagery (MI) tasks [2]. Specifically, studies show the power of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) measured differs according to handedness. The Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) is an oscillatory idle rhythm of synchronized electric brain activity with a brainwave frequency between alpha and beta waves (12-15 Hz) [3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to collect and process brainwaves and investigate the difference in brain waves for left and right-handed users. The result can potentially contribute to building a more accurate and effective BCI. In addition, building a machine learning classification model to predict hand dominance is important. Research suggests that there is an intimate association between hand dominance and brain specialization. It also provides an opportunity for parents to predict the hand preference of babies.\n"

EEG tracks and records brain wave patterns by measuring the voltage fluctuations in the brain which result from neuronal activity.  The electric pulses in an EEG recording are sinusoidal in nature and this allows medical professionals to rapidly evaluate irregularitiies."
